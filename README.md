## How to use these files

The best way to use these files is to simply clone this repository to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` folder which is usually `~/.config` unless you changed it.

```bash
git clone -b android https://github.com/8rents/git $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git
```

### Install Required Dependencies

```bash
apt update && \
apt install -y git gh diffutils git-delta most nano gnupg
```

#### Dependencies List for My Git Config

- `git` (obviously)
- `gh` - GitHub CLI tool, used for signing into GitHub
- `git-delta` - delta is used as git's pager and merge tool
- `diffutils` - diff3 is the set difftool, which comes in this package
- `most` - system pager, especially for colored man docs
- `nano` - text editor for writing commit messages. Maybe more...
- `gnupg` - Creating a signing PGP key to sign commits with and encrypting secret files

## Included Files

There are a few different files that are at play here.

```
git/
├── config
├── config.d/
├── docs/
└── ignore
```
**Files**

- `config` - The main configuration file. This file is loaded first 
- `ignore` - The user level global ignore file

**Folders**

- `docs/` - Directory holding documentation and git related articles
- `config.d/` - Directory holding a modularized version of the config file
 
## The `config.d` Directory. *Modularizing Git Configs to the High Heavens*

I decided to make my git configuration extremely modular so that I can reuse components across different systems (branches). The global `config` file has been split into many smaller files within the `config.d` directory.

### What's in `config.d`?

```
config.d
├── aliases
│   ├── abbr.gitconfig
│   └── macros.gitconfig
├── colors
│   ├── auto.gitconfig
│   ├── new-color-scheme-template.gitconfig
│   └── tomorrow-night-eighties.gitconfig
├── messages
│   └── commit
│       ├── conventional
│       └── human-readable
├── pagers
│   └── delta
│       └── dark-catppuccin-mocha.gitconfig
├── repos
│   └── default
└── users
    └── brent.gitconfig
```

#### Aliases

Aliases make commands quicker and easier to execute. They also help to prevent syntax errors because they have already been done. 

> *You can assign as many alias files as you want. Both abbriviations and macros are loaded*

##### Abbreviation Aliases: `abbr.gitconfig`

Stands for abbreviation. These are abbriviated aliases like `g caa` for `git commit -a`

Almost every Git command and option are outlined in the `abbr.gitconfig` file, with the most helpful and necessary commands being aliases right inside the commamd refetence itself.

##### Macro Aliases: `macros.gitconfig`

More complex git commands that don't rely on abbreviations and often strive to use more plain english.

#### Color Schemes

Git has the ability to recolor every bit of it's command line interface. 

> *You can only select one color scheme at a time*

- `auto.gitconfig` `[selected]` - the default color scheme, which is also git's default. 
- `tomorrow-night-eighties.gitconfig` - is a custom color scheme that uses it's own hex values instead  of using the existing terminal color values. It's more experimental and more of a demo than anything.

##### Creating New Color Schemes for Git

I've included a template that has just about every color property notated and ready to use. 

1. Make a copy of `new-color-scheme-template.gitconfig` and rename it.
2. Open the new copy and start adding values
3. Add the new color file to be included in the main `config` file under `[include]`

##### Messages

The messages folder holds different types of messages. So far it only has 2 types of commit message templates. 

###### Commit Messages

> *You can only use one commit message template at a time*

- `conventional` `[selected]` - The conventional message template is designed to be read by people and machines in build pipe lines and to be the data baclend to auto-generate chamgelogs noce and cleanly
- `human-readable` - Is less suited to automations and more for the simple human mind and it difficulty reading things that look archaic.

##### Pagers

Include a pager profile from within the `pager` directory. Right now there is only 1 pager profile. A delta cappuccin dark theme.

**Path:** `config.d/pagers/delta/dark/catppuccin/mocha.config`

### Picking other delta theme

To view:

- dark themes - `delta --show-syntax-themes --dark`
- light themes - `delta --show-syntax-themes --light`


#### Repos

This directory is defined as the `templateDir` in which to auto populate new repos with certain assets. I'm now pretty sure those assets dont populate the initialized directory, but the `.git` folder within it. Which is not what I was hoping for.

#### Users

The Users directory holds user profiles. User profiles are pretty straight forward. Name, Email, Username... That's about it.
