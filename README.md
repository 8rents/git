# Git Configuration Files

> *Fully realized git configuration files. Just about all of the variables and settings are included.*

## How to use these files

The best way to use these files is to simply clone this repository to `.config/git` in your users home directory.

You can also symlink the directory to `~/.config/git` and leave it in another location.

## Included Files

There are a few different files that are at play here.

- `config` - The main configuration file. This file is loaded first 
- `ignore` - The user level global ignore file
- `aliases` - A file of aliases to make using git on the CLI easier.
